#### Specific Gravity Corrector for a Triple Scale Hydrometer. Useful tool in homebrewing

##### In progress  

The program displays a form asking for specific gravity and temperature. After clicking on the button, the corrected value will show in the screen.


**Progress:** 
- The form is displayed.  
- Wrote a method that makes calculations and returns the adjusted o.g. based on the temperature.  
- The application converts the string values in the fields to numbers and displays an error if not.


Needs to refactor the user input validation
