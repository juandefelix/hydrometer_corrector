### Specific Gravity Corrector for a Triple Scale Hydrometer. Useful tool in homebrewing.

This application displays a form asking for specific gravity of a liquid (measured by a hydrometer) and the temperature of the liquid. After clicking on the button, the corrected specific gravity value will display in the screen. If the input values are the wrong type or not in the right range an error message will display.

#### Using this application

- This is a little application that uses HTML and JavaScript to do the calculations.
Download the application folder typing in your terminal

  `git clone https://github.com/juandefelix/hydrometer_corrector.git`

  Inside the folder you will see the `index.html` file.
